# goeliza

goeliza is a Go implementation of Weizenbaum's [ELIZA chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), which is a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. 

Based on Evan Dempsey's [Python implementation](https://www.smallsurething.com/implementing-the-famous-eliza-chatbot-in-python/) and Norbert Landsteiner's [JavaScript implementation](http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/).

## Notes

All the functionality is contained in the package `goeliza`.

You can play around with the terminal interface in the `terminal_eliza` folder. Just run `go build` in the directory to compile, and run as usual.
